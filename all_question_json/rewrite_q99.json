  "stem_md": "On average, 7 ships pass by the lighthouse each hour, following a Poisson process. The lighthouse keeper needs 10 minutes to refuel the lantern for each ship's signal. Compute the **sum of the mean and variance** of total refueling time (in hours) for ships arriving in a given 1-hour watch period.",
  "hints": [
    "First, model the number of ships as a Poisson random variable with λ=7.",
    "Convert the per-ship refueling time to hours (10 minutes = 1/6 hours).",
    "Use linearity of expectation and the property Var(aX) = a²Var(X) for the scaled Poisson variable."
