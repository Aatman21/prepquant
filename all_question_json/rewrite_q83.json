  "stem_md": "A lighthouse keeper can refill a lantern's fuel tank in 3 minutes if the tide helps by pushing fuel through the pipes faster, but it takes 4 minutes if the tide opposes the flow. How long would it take to refill the tank if the tide were still (no current)?\n\n*Assume the fuel flow rate is constant and the tide's effect is additive.*",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – The keeper's base refill speed and the tide's effect combine additively.",
    "Hint 2 – Set up two equations: one for the helping tide and one for the opposing tide.",
    "Hint 3 – Solve the system of equations to isolate the keeper's base refill speed without tide effects."

  "detailed_solution_md": "Let:\n- $r$ = keeper's base refill rate (tanks per minute)\n- $x$ = tide's effect on refill rate (tanks per minute)\n\n**With helping tide (faster flow):**\n$$ r + x = \\frac{1 \\text{ tank}}{3 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n**With opposing tide (slower flow):**\n$$ r - x = \\frac{1 \\text{ tank}}{4 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\n**Step 1:** Add the two equations to eliminate $x$:\n$$ (r + x) + (r - x) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} $$\n$$ 2r = \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12} $$\n$$ r = \\frac{7}{24} \\text{ tanks/minute} $$\n\n**Step 2:** Time to refill 1 tank without tide:\n$$ \\text{Time} = \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{24}{7} \\text{ minutes} $$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$$ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ minutes}} $$",
