  "stem_md": "Two friends, Alex and Jamie, are preparing a campsite. They each independently pick a number of firewood logs from a pile containing 1 to 5 logs, with each number equally likely. They arrange the logs to form a right-angled cooking area: one side uses all of Alex's logs laid in a straight line, and the other side uses all of Jamie's logs similarly. \n\nWhat is the expected area of the triangular cooking space they can create?",
  "hints": [
    "The area of a right triangle is half the product of the two perpendicular sides.",
    "Since Alex and Jamie choose independently, the expected value of the product is the product of their individual expected choices.",
    "Calculate the expected number of logs each would pick, then use the area formula."
  ],
  "detailed_solution_md": "Let $A$ and $J$ represent the number of logs Alex and Jamie pick, respectively. Both $A$ and $J$ are uniformly distributed over $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\n1. **Expected Value of $A$ and $J$**: Since the distribution is uniform, the expected number of logs each picks is the average of the possible values:\n   $$ E[A] = E[J] = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{5} = 3 $$\n\n2. **Area of the Cooking Space**: The area formed is a right triangle with legs of lengths $A$ and $J$, so the area is:\n   $$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times A \\times J $$\n\n3. **Expected Area**: Because $A$ and $J$ are independent, the expected area is:\n   $$ E[\\text{Area}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times E[A] \\times E[J] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2} $$\n\n**Final Answer**: The expected area of the triangular cooking space is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{2}}$.",
