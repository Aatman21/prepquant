  "title": "The Librarian's Arbitrage Scroll",
  "stem_md": "In the quiet alcoves of the *Old Tome Library*, you discover:\n\n- A rare *manuscript* priced at $M = 10$ silver coins.\n- A *reading permit* (call option) for the manuscript at $C = 4$ coins, strike $K = 4$.\n- A *return vow* (put option) for the same manuscript at $P = 3$ coins, same strike.\n- *Promise scrolls* (bonds) that pay 1 coin at time $T$ (interest rates are 0%).\n\n**Task:** The librarian whispers that the *Permit-Vow Parity* $C - P = M - K$ is violated. Find an arbitrage strategy using combinations of Manuscripts ($M$), Permits ($C$), Vows ($P$), and Promise Scrolls (bonds). Express your answer as $\\#M + \\#C + \\#P + \\#\\text{Bonds}$.",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – The Permit-Vow Parity suggests $C - P$ should equal $M - K$. Check both sides.",
    "Hint 2 – If one side is cheaper, buy it; if the other is dearer, sell it. Think 'long the undervalued, short the overvalued'.",
    "Hint 3 – To replicate $M - K$, you'll need to short the manuscript and hold enough bonds to cover the strike."
