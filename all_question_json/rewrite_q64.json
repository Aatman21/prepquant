  "stem_md": "At the village fair, you're playing a game with a friendly stallholder. You roll a standard 6-sided die. You can either:\n\n1. **Keep your roll** and win that many shiny tokens immediately.\n2. **Roll again**, but there's a twist:\n   - If the sum of both rolls is **7 or more**, you must *give back* tokens equal to your first roll.\n   - If the sum is **less than 7**, you win tokens equal to the total of both rolls.\n\nAssuming you play optimally to maximize your expected tokens, what's your average winnings per game?",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – Consider each possible first roll (1 through 6) separately. For each, decide whether to keep it or roll again by comparing the immediate value to the expected value of rolling again.",
    "Hint 2 – For rolling again: calculate the probability of the sum being ≥7 (bad outcome) or <7 (good outcome), then compute the expected tokens for each case.",
    "Hint 3 – You'll find it's optimal to roll again only if the first roll is 1 or 2. For 3+, keeping the first roll is better. Combine these cases with their probabilities to find the overall expected winnings."

  "detailed_solution_md": "Let's analyze each possible first roll $k$ (where $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$):\n\n1. **First roll = 1**\n   - If you roll again:\n     - Sum ≥7: Only if second roll is 6 ($\\frac{1}{6}$ chance). You lose 1 token.\n     - Sum <7: Second roll is 1-5 ($\\frac{5}{6}$ chance). You win $(1 + \\text{second roll})$ tokens.\n     - Expected value: $\\frac{1}{6}(-1) + \\frac{1}{6}(2+3+4+5+6) = \\frac{19}{6} > 1$ → **Roll again**.\n\n2. **First roll = 2**\n   - If you roll again:\n     - Sum ≥7: Second roll is 5 or 6 ($\\frac{2}{6}$ chance). You lose 2 tokens.\n     - Sum <7: Second roll is 1-4 ($\\frac{4}{6}$ chance). You win $(2 + \\text{second roll})$ tokens.\n     - Expected value: $\\frac{2}{6}(-2) + \\frac{1}{6}(3+4+5+6) = \\frac{14}{6} > 2$ → **Roll again**.\n\n3. **First roll = 3**\n   - If you roll again:\n     - Sum ≥7: Second roll is 4,5, or 6 ($\\frac{3}{6}$ chance). You lose 3 tokens.\n     - Sum <7: Second roll is 1-3 ($\\frac{3}{6}$ chance). You win $(3 + \\text{second roll})$ tokens.\n     - Expected value: $\\frac{3}{6}(-3) + \\frac{1}{6}(4+5+6) = 1 < 3$ → **Keep the 3**.\n\n4. **First roll ≥4**\n   - Similar logic shows keeping the roll is always better (e.g., for 4: expected value if rolling again is $-\\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{5+6}{6} = -0.5 < 4$).\n\n**Overall expected winnings**:\n- For $k=1,2$: Use the expected values from rolling again ($\\frac{19}{6}$ and $\\frac{14}{6}$).\n- For $k=3,4,5,6$: Keep the roll's value.\n- Combine with equal probabilities ($\\frac{1}{6}$ each):\n$$\\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{19}{6} + \\frac{14}{6} + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{33}{6} + 18\\right) = \\frac{47}{12}$$\n\n**Final answer**: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{12}}$ tokens on average.",
