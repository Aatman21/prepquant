  "title": "The Sliding Tome Ladder",
  "stem_md": "In the quiet **Athenaeum Library**, a 50-foot antique ladder leans against a towering bookshelf. The ladder's base rests on a polished marble floor slick with spilled candle wax, causing it to slide outward at a steady pace of 4 feet per minute. Meanwhile, the top of the ladder glides silently down the shelf.\n\nWhen the base is **30 feet** from the shelf, at what rate (in radians per minute) is the **angle between the ladder and floor** shrinking? Assume the bookshelf is perfectly vertical.",
  "hints": [
    "Sketch the scenario as a right triangle with the ladder as hypotenuse. What's the height of the ladder's tip when the base is 30 feet out?",
    "Relate the angle $\\theta$ to the triangle's sides via $\\tan\\theta$. Differentiate this relationship with respect to time.",
    "You'll need the derivative of the vertical position (from the Pythagorean relationship) and $\\sec^2\\theta$ expressed in terms of the sides."
