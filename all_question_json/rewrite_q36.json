  "stem_md": "Three friends—Alex, Blair, and Casey—are preparing for a camping trip. They track how well their packing habits align using a correlation measure. We know:\n\n- The packing correlation between Alex and Blair is $\\frac{5}{13}$.\n- The packing correlation between Blair and Casey is $\\frac{12}{13}$.\n\n**Question**: The possible values for the packing correlation between Alex and Casey, $\\rho$, lie in an interval $[0, b]$. Find the fully reduced fraction $b$.",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – The packing correlations form a matrix that must satisfy certain mathematical properties to be valid.",
    "Hint 2 – The determinant of the 3×3 correlation matrix must be non-negative for the correlations to be consistent.",
    "Hint 3 – Solve the quadratic inequality derived from the determinant condition to find the upper bound $b$."

  "detailed_solution_md": "To find the range of possible values for $\\rho$, the correlation between Alex and Casey, we construct the correlation matrix $C$:\n\n$$ C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\frac{5}{13} & \\rho \\\\\n\\frac{5}{13} & 1 & \\frac{12}{13} \\\\\n\\rho & \\frac{12}{13} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nFor the matrix to be valid (positive semi-definite), its determinant must be non-negative. First, compute the determinant of $C$:\n\n$$ \\det(C) = 1 \\cdot \\left(1 \\cdot 1 - \\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right)^2\\right) - \\frac{5}{13} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{13} \\cdot 1 - \\rho \\cdot \\frac{12}{13}\\right) + \\rho \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{13} \\cdot \\frac{12}{13} - \\rho \\cdot 1\\right) $$\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1. First term: $1 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{144}{169}\\right) = \\frac{25}{169}$\n2. Second term: $-\\frac{5}{13} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{13} - \\frac{12}{13}\\rho\\right) = -\\frac{25}{169} + \\frac{60}{169}\\rho$\n3. Third term: $\\rho \\cdot \\left(\\frac{60}{169} - \\rho\\right) = \\frac{60}{169}\\rho - \\rho^2$\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n$$ \\det(C) = \\frac{25}{169} - \\frac{25}{169} + \\frac{60}{169}\\rho + \\frac{60}{169}\\rho - \\rho^2 = \\frac{120}{169}\\rho - \\rho^2 $$\n\nSet the determinant to be non-negative:\n\n$$ \\frac{120}{169}\\rho - \\rho^2 \\geq 0 $$\n\nFactor the inequality:\n\n$$ \\rho \\left(\\frac{120}{169} - \\rho\\right) \\geq 0 $$\n\nThis inequality holds when $\\rho$ is between the roots $0$ and $\\frac{120}{169}$. Since the coefficient of $\\rho^2$ is negative, the parabola opens downward, so the determinant is non-negative in the interval $[0, \\frac{120}{169}]$.\n\nThus, the upper bound $b$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{120}{169}}$.",
