  "stem_md": "You're organizing a carnival parade with two spinning wheels: one **rainbow-colored** and one **starry-night-colored**, each with 10 sections labeled 1 through 10. You spin both wheels simultaneously. If they land on the same section, the game ends. If they show different sections, but the starry-night wheel lands on a section at least 3 higher than the rainbow wheel, you win a **golden ticket** and can spin again. Otherwise, you win nothing and spin again. The game only ends when both wheels match. What's the expected number of golden tickets you'll win?",
  "hints": [
    "First, calculate the probability that the starry-night wheel lands exactly 3 or more sections ahead of the rainbow wheel.",
    "Next, find the probability that both wheels match (game ends) or neither condition is met (continue spinning).",
    "Set up an expectation equation where the expected value $e$ depends on the outcomes of the first spin, considering the game might restart with an additional golden ticket."
  ],
  "detailed_solution_md": "Let $e$ be the expected number of golden tickets.\n\n1. **Probability starry-night wheel is â‰¥3 higher than rainbow wheel**:  \n   For each value $k$ (1 to 10) on the rainbow wheel, the starry-night wheel must land on $k+3$ to $10$. The number of valid outcomes is $10 - (k+3) + 1 = 8 - k$.  \n   Total favorable outcomes: $\\sum_{k=1}^{10} (8 - k) = 7 + 6 + \\dots + 0 = 28$.  \n   Total possible outcomes: $10 \\times 10 = 100$.  \n   Probability: $\\frac{28}{100} = \\frac{7}{25}$.\n\n2. **Probability wheels match (game ends)**:  \n   There are 10 matching pairs out of 100, so $\\frac{10}{100} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\n3. **Probability neither condition is met (continue spinning)**:  \n   This is $1 - \\frac{7}{25} - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{50}{50} - \\frac{14}{50} - \\frac{5}{50} = \\frac{31}{50}$.\n\n4. **Expectation equation**:  \n   If the first spin gives a golden ticket, the game restarts with $e + 1$ expected tickets. Otherwise, it restarts with $e$ tickets. Thus:  \n   $$ e = \\frac{7}{25}(e + 1) + \\frac{31}{50}e $$  \n   Multiply through by 50 to eliminate denominators:  \n   $$ 50e = 14(e + 1) + 31e $$  \n   Expand and simplify:  \n   $$ 50e = 14e + 14 + 31e $$  \n   $$ 50e = 45e + 14 $$  \n   $$ 5e = 14 $$  \n   **Final answer**: $e = \\boxed{\\frac{14}{5}}$ golden tickets.",
