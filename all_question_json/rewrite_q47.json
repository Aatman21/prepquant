  "stem_md": "In a sunlit forest clearing, two mischievous squirrels are moving acorns between two picnic baskets. Basket A has an average acorn replenishment rate of $\\mu_A = 4\\%$ per hour with replenishment volatility of $\\sigma_A^2 = 15\\%$. Basket B has $\\mu_B = 2\\%$ replenishment rate and $\\sigma_B^2 = 4\\%$ volatility. Their acorn movements are perfectly anti-correlated ($\\rho = -1$).\n\nYou want to create a *stable* picnic setup where the total number of acorns never fluctuates. Let $w$ be the fraction of acorns placed in Basket A, and $(1-w)$ in Basket B. Find $w$ to 2 decimal places.",
  "hints": [
    "What condition makes the acorn count perfectly stable? Think about volatility cancellation.",
    "Set up the variance equation for the combined baskets. Anti-correlation means movements offset each other.",
    "Solve $w^2\\sigma_A^2 + 2w(1-w)\\rho\\sigma_A\\sigma_B + (1-w)^2\\sigma_B^2 = 0$ with $\\rho=-1$. The replenishment rates don't affect stability."
