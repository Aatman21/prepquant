  "stem_md": "In a vibrant art studio, there's a drying rack with **2 red canvases** and **1 blue canvas**. Each day, you randomly pick a canvas from the rack to work on. Regardless of its color, you replace it with a fresh **blue canvas**. What's the expected number of days until the rack contains only blue canvases?",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – Break the problem into stages: first, how many days to go from 1 to 2 blue canvases, then from 2 to 3?",
    "Hint 2 – Each stage is like waiting for a 'success' (replacing a red canvas). What's the probability of success at each stage?",
    "Hint 3 – The first stage follows $X_1 \\sim \\text{Geom}(\\frac{2}{3})$, and the second $X_2 \\sim \\text{Geom}(\\frac{1}{3})$. Use linearity of expectation."
