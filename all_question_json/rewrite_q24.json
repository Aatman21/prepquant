  "stem_md": "At the Happy Paws Rescue Center, we track two factors for each dog's adoption speed: \n1. $b$: bowls of food eaten per day\n2. $p$: hours spent in playpen daily\n\nWe ran two simple regressions:\n- Adoption speed $\\sim \\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 b$ (R² = 0.05)\n- Adoption speed $\\sim \\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 p$ (R² = 0.05)\n\n**Find the lowest possible upper bound** for the R² value when predicting adoption speed using **both factors**: $\\text{Adoption speed} \\sim \\alpha + \\beta' b + \\beta'' p$.",

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1: Construct Extreme Case**\n\nLet adoption speed follow a perfect quadratic relationship with food:\n$$\\text{Adoption speed} = (b - 10)^2$$\n\nNow define playpen time as:\n$$p = b^2$$\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Individual Regressions**\n\n1. Linear model $\\text{Adoption speed} \\sim \\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 b$:\n   - Can't fit quadratic relationship ⇒ Low R² = 0.05\n\n2. Model $\\text{Adoption speed} \\sim \\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 p$:\n   - Rewrites as $\\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 b^2$\n   - Still can't match $(b-10)^2 = b^2 - 20b + 100$ ⇒ Low R² = 0.05\n\n**Step 3: Combined Model Performance**\n\nThe full model:\n$$\\text{Adoption speed} = \\alpha + \\beta' b + \\beta'' p$$\nCan exactly represent the quadratic relationship:\n$$\\alpha = 100, \\beta' = -20, \\beta'' = 1$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 100 - 20b + 1\\cdot b^2 = (b-10)^2$$\n\n**Conclusion**: The upper bound is achievable when predictors combine to perfectly explain the response.\n\n\\boxed{1}",
