  "stem_md": "Two beachgoers, Sandy and Windy, are building sandcastles near the shore. Their castle heights (Sandy's $S$ and Windy's $W$) follow a special pattern where:\n\n1. Each castle's height varies like the tides: normally distributed with average height 0 and variability 1.\n2. Their heights are linked by a *decorative shell factor* $\\rho$ (correlation between $S$ and $W$).\n\n**Task**: Compute the *synchronized decoration effect* between Sandy's castle height and the **square** of Windy's castle height, defined as:\n$$\\text{Cov}(S, W^2) = E[SW^2] - E[S]E[W^2]$$",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – Recall that $E[S]=0$ since Sandy's castle height averages to zero.",
    "Hint 2 – Express $W$ in terms of two independent tide patterns (say, $T_1$ and $T_2$) using the shell factor $\\rho$.",
    "Hint 3 – Expand $E[SW^2]$ using the expression for $W$ and note that odd moments of normal tide patterns vanish."

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1: Simplify the Covariance**\nGiven $S \\sim N(0,1)$, its expected height is $E[S] = 0$. Thus:\n$$\\text{Cov}(S, W^2) = E[SW^2] - \\cancel{E[S]E[W^2]} = E[SW^2]$$\n\n**Step 2: Express $W$ via Independent Tides**\nRepresent $W$ using two independent tide patterns $T_1, T_2 \\sim N(0,1)$:\n$$W = \\rho T_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}T_2$$\nSince $S$ is perfectly correlated with $T_1$, we set $S = T_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Expand $E[SW^2]$**\nSubstitute $W$ and $S = T_1$:\n$$E[SW^2] = E\\left[T_1 \\left(\\rho T_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}T_2\\right)^2\\right]$$\nExpand the square:\n$$= E\\left[T_1 \\left(\\rho^2 T_1^2 + 2\\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}T_1T_2 + (1-\\rho^2)T_2^2\\right)\\right]$$\nDistribute $T_1$ and linearity of expectation:\n$$= \\rho^2 E[T_1^3] + 2\\rho\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}E[T_1^2T_2] + (1-\\rho^2)E[T_1T_2^2]$$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Expectations**\n- $E[T_1^3] = 0$ (odd moment of normal).\n- $E[T_1^2T_2] = E[T_1^2]E[T_2] = 1 \\times 0 = 0$ (independence + $E[T_2]=0$).\n- $E[T_1T_2^2] = E[T_1]E[T_2^2] = 0 \\times 1 = 0$ (independence + $E[T_1]=0$).\n\n**Final Answer**:\nAll terms vanish, so:\n$$\\boxed{\\text{Cov}(S, W^2) = 0}$$",
