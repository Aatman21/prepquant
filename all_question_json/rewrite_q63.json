  "stem_md": "You and four other forest creatures are sitting in a circle around a giant oak tree. A mischievous squirrel starts the game by placing a prized acorn in your picnic basket. Every rustle of the leaves (each turn), the creature holding the acorn has three equally likely choices:\n\n1. Pass the acorn **left** to the neighboring basket\n2. Pass the acorn **right** to the neighboring basket\n3. **Keep** the acorn (ending the game)\n\nWhat's the probability you ultimately end up with the acorn?",
  "hints": [
    "Consider symmetry: creatures at equal distances from you behave identically.",
    "Define states based on the acorn's current holder: you, your neighbors, or the furthest creatures.",
    "Set up recursive equations where each state's probability depends on possible next moves."
  ],
  "detailed_solution_md": "We model the game using three states:\n\n- **$P_1$**: Probability you end with the acorn **starting from you**.\n- **$P_2$**: Probability you end with the acorn **starting from either neighbor** (symmetry!).\n- **$P_3$**: Probability you end with the acorn **starting from the furthest creatures** (also symmetric).\n\n**Recursive equations** account for all possible moves:\n\n1. **Your turn ($P_1$):**\n   - Keep immediately: $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance.\n   - Pass left/right (each $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → neighbor now holds it ($P_2$).\n   $$P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}P_2$$\n\n2. **Neighbor's turn ($P_2$):**\n   - Pass back to you ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → now $P_1$.\n   - Pass further away ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → furthest creature ($P_3$).\n   - Keep ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → game ends, you **don’t** get it ($0$).\n   $$P_2 = \\frac{1}{3}P_1 + \\frac{1}{3}P_3$$\n\n3. **Furthest creature's turn ($P_3$):**\n   - Pass toward you ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → neighbor ($P_2$).\n   - Pass away ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → other furthest creature (still $P_3$).\n   - Keep ($\\frac{1}{3}$ chance) → game ends, you **don’t** get it ($0$).\n   $$P_3 = \\frac{1}{3}P_2 + \\frac{1}{3}P_3$$\n\n**Solving the system:**\n1. From $P_3$'s equation:\n   $$P_3 - \\frac{1}{3}P_3 = \\frac{1}{3}P_2 \\implies \\frac{2}{3}P_3 = \\frac{1}{3}P_2 \\implies P_3 = \\frac{1}{2}P_2$$\n2. Substitute $P_3$ into $P_2$'s equation:\n   $$P_2 = \\frac{1}{3}P_1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}P_2\\right) \\implies P_2 = \\frac{1}{3}P_1 + \\frac{1}{6}P_2$$\n   $$P_2 - \\frac{1}{6}P_2 = \\frac{1}{3}P_1 \\implies \\frac{5}{6}P_2 = \\frac{1}{3}P_1 \\implies P_2 = \\frac{2}{5}P_1$$\n3. Substitute $P_2$ into $P_1$'s equation:\n   $$P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}P_1\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{4}{15}P_1$$\n   $$P_1 - \\frac{4}{15}P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies \\frac{11}{15}P_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\implies P_1 = \\frac{5}{11}$$\n\n**Final answer:** The probability you keep the acorn is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{11}}$.",
