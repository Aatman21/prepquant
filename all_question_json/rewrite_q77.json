  "stem_md": "Two teammates, *Sandy* and *Tina*, are building sandcastles at different times. Sandy starts at time $s$ (low tide) and Tina at time $t$ (high tide), where $0 \\leq s \\leq t$. Their castle heights (in cm) follow the *Tidal Random Walk*:\n\n- At any time $\\tau$, height $H_\\tau \\sim N(0, \\tau)$ (mean 0, variance $\\tau$).\n- Increments like $H_t - H_s$ are independent of $H_s$.\n\nCompute the **height synchronization metric** $\\text{Cov}(H_s, H_t)$ between their castles when $s=1$, $t=2$.",

    "The synchronization metric breaks into two parts: $E[H_s H_t] - E[H_s]E[H_t]$. What simplifies given $H_\\tau$'s mean?",
    "Express $H_t$ as $(H_t - H_s) + H_s$. Why does independence make $E[H_s (H_t - H_s)] = 0$?",
    "The remaining term $E[H_s^2]$ equals the variance of $H_s$ because $E[H_s] = 0$."
