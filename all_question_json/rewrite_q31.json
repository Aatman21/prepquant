  "stem_md": "Five picnic baskets contain different amounts of acorns. Three baskets have $a$, $b$, and $c$ acorns respectively, while the other two baskets have $x$ and $y$ acorns each. The mischievous squirrels report that the average number of acorns per basket is $\\mu$. What is the average number of acorns in the $x$ and $y$ baskets?\n\nGiven:\n- $a = 5$ acorns (tiny basket)\n- $b = 6$ acorns (small basket)\n- $c = 11$ acorns (medium basket)\n- $\\mu = 20$ acorns average",
  "hints": [
    "First calculate the total acorns all baskets should have based on the average.",
    "Subtract the known acorns ($a + b + c$) from this total to find $x + y$.",
    "Finally, divide $x + y$ by 2 to get their average."
