  "stem_md": "A bakery displays a tower of $7$ freshly baked croissants stacked vertically, labeled $1$ to $7$ from top to bottom. Croissant $1$ is attached to the ceiling, and each subsequent croissant is linked to the one above it by a delicate sugar thread. Each minute, a remaining sugar thread is chosen uniformly at random and snapped. This causes all croissants below the broken thread to crumble and fall. What is the expected number of snaps needed until only croissant $1$ remains intact?",

    "Consider the problem recursively: after the first snap, the remaining croissants form a smaller tower.",
    "Define $E_n$ as the expected snaps for a tower of $n$ croissants. Relate $E_n$ to $E_{k-1}$ where $k$ is the position of the first snapped thread.",
    "Show that $E_n = E_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n}$ by examining the difference $E_n - E_{n-1}$ and using the recurrence relation."

  "detailed_solution_md": "Let $E_n$ be the expected number of snaps needed to reduce a tower of $n$ croissants to just the top one. We derive a recurrence relation by considering the first snap:\n\n1. **First snap position**: If the $k$-th sugar thread (counting from the top) is snapped first, the croissants $k+1$ to $n$ fall. The remaining problem is to reduce the top $k-1$ croissants.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: By the law of total expectation,\n   $$E_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n (1 + E_{k-1}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} E_k$$\n   where $E_0 = 0$ (no croissants need no snaps).\n\n3. **Difference analysis**: Compute $E_n - E_{n-1}$:\n   $$E_n - E_{n-1} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} E_k\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k\\right)$$\n   Simplify using the recurrence relation for $E_{n-1}$:\n   $$E_n - E_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n} E_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k - \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k$$\n   Combine terms:\n   $$E_n - E_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n} E_{n-1} + \\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right) \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k$$\n   The coefficient simplifies to $-\\frac{1}{n(n-1)}$:\n   $$E_n - E_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n} E_{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n(n-1)} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k$$\n   Recognize that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} E_k = (n-1)(E_{n-1} - 1)$ from the recurrence for $E_{n-1}$:\n   $$E_n - E_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n} E_{n-1} - \\frac{(n-1)(E_{n-1} - 1)}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{1}{n}$$\n\n4. **Solution**: The telescoping series gives:\n   $$E_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}$$\n   For $n=6$ threads (since croissant $1$ is fixed to the ceiling), the expected snaps are:\n   $$E_6 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{49}{20}$$\n\n**Final answer**: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{49}{20}}$",
