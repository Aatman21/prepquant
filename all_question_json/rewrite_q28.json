  "stem_md": "In a sunny orchard, there are 10 fruit baskets labeled from 1 to 10 arranged in a row. A picker selects a subset of baskets to harvest. How many subsets contain **exactly one pair of consecutive baskets**? For example, selecting baskets {3, 5, 6, 9} includes exactly one consecutive pair (5 and 6).",
  "hints": [
    "Think of the problem as placing 'harvest' (H) and 'skip' (S) markers on the baskets, ensuring only one pair of H markers are adjacent.",
    "Use a combinatorial approach by considering the placement of the consecutive pair and the remaining baskets, treating the pair as a single block.",
    "Break the problem into cases based on the total number of baskets harvested, and use multinomial coefficients to count valid arrangements for each case."

  "detailed_solution_md": "We model the problem by considering the selection of baskets as a sequence of 'harvest' (H) and 'skip' (S) decisions, with exactly one pair of consecutive H's. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Total baskets**: 10 (labeled 1 to 10).\n2. **Problem**: Count subsets with exactly one pair of consecutive baskets. This is equivalent to counting sequences of H and S with exactly one 'HH' block.\n3. **Approach**: Treat the consecutive pair 'HH' as a single block (call it 'B'). The remaining H's must not be adjacent to each other or to B.\n\n**Case Breakdown**:\n- Let $k$ be the total number of baskets harvested (including the pair). For each $k$, we count valid arrangements.\n\n**Case 1: $k = 6$ (6 baskets harvested, 4 skipped)**\n- The block B (HH) and 4 single H's must be placed with gaps.\n- Total items to arrange: B + 4H + 4S = 9 items.\n- The number of ways is $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ (choose positions for H's in the gaps).\n\n**Case 2: $k = 5$ (5 baskets harvested, 5 skipped)**\n- Items: B + 3H + 5S = 9 items.\n- Arrangements: $\\binom{6}{3,1,2} = 60$ (multinomial coefficient for B, H, S).\n\n**Case 3: $k = 4$ (4 baskets harvested, 6 skipped)**\n- Items: B + 2H + 6S = 9 items.\n- Arrangements: $\\binom{7}{2,1,4} = 105$.\n\n**Case 4: $k = 3$ (3 baskets harvested, 7 skipped)**\n- Items: B + 1H + 7S = 9 items.\n- Arrangements: $\\binom{8}{1,1,6} = 56$.\n\n**Case 5: $k = 2$ (2 baskets harvested, 8 skipped)**\n- Items: B + 8S = 9 items.\n- Arrangements: $\\binom{9}{8} = 9$.\n\n**Total subsets**: Sum all cases:\n$$5 + 60 + 105 + 56 + 9 = \\boxed{235}.$$\n\n**Final Answer**: There are $\\boxed{235}$ valid subsets with exactly one pair of consecutive baskets.",
