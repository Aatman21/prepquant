  "stem_md": "At the village fair, the balloon stall has $5$ golden balloons and $8$ silver balloons. The stall keeper pops balloons one by one until none are left. What is the probability that when the last golden balloon is popped, there are exactly $2$ silver balloons remaining?",
  "hints": [
    "Think about the sequence of balloons being popped and focus on the last few balloons.",
    "Consider that the last golden balloon must be the third from the end, followed by two silver balloons.",
    "Calculate the probability of the specific sequence where the last three balloons popped are golden, silver, silver in that order."

  "detailed_solution_md": "To solve this problem, we can consider the sequence of balloon pops. We want the last golden balloon to be popped when exactly $2$ silver balloons remain. This means the last three balloons popped must be in the order: golden, silver, silver.\n\n1. **Total Balloons**: There are $5$ golden and $8$ silver balloons, totaling $13$ balloons.\n\n2. **Probability of Specific Sequence**: We need the last three balloons to be golden, silver, silver in that exact order.\n   - The probability the third-to-last balloon is golden: $\\frac{5}{13}$.\n   - Given that, the probability the next is silver: $\\frac{8}{12}$.\n   - Then, the probability the last is silver: $\\frac{7}{11}$.\n\n3. **Combined Probability**: Multiply these probabilities together:\n   $$\\frac{5}{13} \\times \\frac{8}{12} \\times \\frac{7}{11} = \\frac{280}{1716} = \\frac{70}{429}$$\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{70}{429}}$.",
