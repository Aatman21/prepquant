  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – How many total blankets are there initially?",
    "Hint 2 – After picking one blanket, how many blankets remain that could form a match?",
    "Hint 3 – The first pick doesn't affect the probability (why?), but the second must match its design."

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1: Total Blankets**  \nThere are $10$ unique designs, each with $2$ blankets, so the total number of blankets is:\n$$10 \\times 2 = 20.$$\n\n**Step 2: First Pick**  \nThe first blanket can be any of the $20$. Since all designs are equally likely, the probability is effectively $1$ (it’s a given).\n\n**Step 3: Second Pick**  \nTo form a match, the second blanket must be the *pair* of the first one. There’s only $1$ matching blanket left out of the remaining $19$ blankets. Thus, the probability is:\n$$\\frac{1}{19}.$$\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe probability of drawing a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{19}}$.",
