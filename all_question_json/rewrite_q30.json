  "stem_md": "In an art studio, a cylindrical paint tube has a cap radius of 1 unit. The tube's thickness (height) is significant enough that when rolled, it can land standing upright on its side. \n\nUsing the method of inscribing the tube inside a sphere, find the tube's thickness $h$ that gives a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability of landing upright. Express $h$ in the form $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$ where $k$ is an integer.",
  "hints": [
    "Visualize the tube inscribed in a sphere. The landing probability relates to the surface area of the sphere 'covered' by the tube's side.",
    "Use the geometric property: the area of a spherical zone (band) between two parallel planes is proportional to the distance between them.",
    "Set up the Pythagorean theorem for the sphere's radius $R$, tube radius 1, and half-thickness $h/2$. Relate $h$ to $R$ via the 1/3 probability condition."

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1: Sphere Inscription**\nInscribe the paint tube (radius $r = 1$, height $h$) in a sphere of radius $R$. The tube's side corresponds to a spherical zone on the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Probability Condition**\nThe probability of landing upright is the ratio of the zone area to the total sphere area. By the zone area theorem:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Zone Area}}{\\text{Sphere Area}} = \\frac{h}{2R} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThus:\n$$h = \\frac{2R}{3} \\quad (1)$$\n\n**Step 3: Pythagorean Setup**\nFrom the sphere's center to the tube's cap, the distance is $h/2$. The right triangle formed gives:\n$$R^2 = \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + 1^2$$\nSubstitute $h$ from (1):\n$$R^2 = \\left(\\frac{R}{3}\\right)^2 + 1$$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for $R$**\n$$R^2 - \\frac{R^2}{9} = 1 \\implies \\frac{8R^2}{9} = 1$$\n$$R^2 = \\frac{9}{8} \\implies R = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\n**Step 5: Find $h$**\nFrom (1):\n$$h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThus, $k = 2$.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe thickness is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}$ with $k = 2$.",
