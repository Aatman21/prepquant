    "Hint 1 – Consider fixing one position in the circle and calculating the probability of a specific sequence starting there.",
    "Hint 2 – The events of the sequence starting at different positions are mutually exclusive because the circle only has 6 chocolate bars total.",

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1: Define the Problem**\nWe have 12 items (6 chocolate bars $C$ and 6 gummy worms $G$) arranged in a circle. We want the probability that somewhere in the circle, there's a sequence of at least four chocolate bars in a row. This is equivalent to finding the probability of the sequence $GCDDD$ appearing somewhere when read clockwise.\n\n**Step 2: Fix a Starting Position**\nLabel the seats 1 through 12. Let $A_i$ be the event that the sequence $GCDDD$ starts at position $i$. We need to find $P\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{12} A_i\\right)$.\n\n**Step 3: Disjoint Events**\nThe events $A_i$ are disjoint because:\n- Only one such sequence can fit in the circle (since there are only 6 chocolate bars).\n- Overlapping sequences would require more chocolate bars than available.\n\nThus, $P\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{12} A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{12} P(A_i)$.\n\n**Step 4: Symmetry and Exchangeability**\nAll positions are equivalent, so $P(A_i) = P(A_1)$ for all $i$. Therefore, the total probability is $12 \\cdot P(A_1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate $P(A_1)$**\nWe need the sequence $GCDDD$ starting at position 1. The number of favorable arrangements is:\n- Choose 1 gummy worm for the first position: $6$ choices.\n- Choose 4 distinct chocolate bars for the next four positions: $6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3$ choices.\n\nThe total number of ways to assign treats to these 5 positions is $12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8$.\n\nThus, $$P(A_1) = \\frac{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3}{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3}{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{1}{44}.$$\n\n**Step 6: Final Probability**\nMultiply by 12 positions:\n$$12 \\cdot P(A_1) = 12 \\cdot \\frac{1}{44} = \\frac{12}{44} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{11}}.$$\n\n**Answer:** The probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{11}}$.",
