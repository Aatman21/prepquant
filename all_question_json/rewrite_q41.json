  "stem_md": "At a carnival, you spin a colorful prize wheel with **6 equally likely segments** labeled with different prize amounts. You keep spinning until the wheel lands on any segment *except* the smallest prize, and you win the amount shown on the final spin. What is the **expected payout** of this game?\n\n*(Assume the wheel is fair and all non-smallest segments have distinct values.)*",
  "hints": [
    "What's the probability the wheel stops on any specific non-smallest segment, given the stopping condition?",
    "Since the wheel is fair, all valid stopping segments are equally likely. How many are there?",
    "Calculate the average of the possible payout values, ignoring the smallest prize segment entirely."

  "detailed_solution_md": "**Step 1:** Identify possible payout segments\n- Wheel segments: $\\{s, a, b, c, d, e\\}$ where $s$ is the smallest prize (ignored)\n- Valid stopping segments: $\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$ (5 equally likely outcomes)\n\n**Step 2:** Compute expected payout\nSince all valid segments are equally likely, the expected payout $E$ is their average:\n$$E = \\frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5}$$\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute uniform distribution values\nFor a standard carnival wheel with consecutive integer prizes (e.g., $a=2, b=3, \\ldots, e=6$):\n$$E = \\frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4$$\n\n**Final answer:** $\\boxed{4}$",
