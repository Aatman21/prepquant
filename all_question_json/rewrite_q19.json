  "stem_md": "A lighthouse keeper has two identical lanterns: one filled with pure kerosene and another with pure whale oil, both of volume $V$ liters. The keeper pours some whale oil into the kerosene lantern, mixes thoroughly, then pours back the same volume of the mixture into the whale oil lantern. Both lanterns end up with $V$ liters again. Let $x$ be the percentage concentration of whale oil in the diluted whale oil lantern, and $y$ be the percentage concentration of kerosene in the diluted kerosene lantern. What is $x - y$?",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – Consider the final amount of whale oil in the kerosene lantern and how it relates to the amount of kerosene in the whale oil lantern.",
    "Hint 2 – Let $w$ be the volume of whale oil that ends up in the kerosene lantern after the exchange. Express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $w$ and $V$.",
    "Hint 3 – Notice that the amount of whale oil in the kerosene lantern must equal the amount of kerosene in the whale oil lantern due to the symmetry of the exchange."

  "detailed_solution_md": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Both lanterns start with $V$ liters—one with pure kerosene and the other with pure whale oil.\n\n2. **First Transfer**: The keeper pours some whale oil into the kerosene lantern. Let’s say $w$ liters of whale oil are transferred. The kerosene lantern now has $V$ liters of kerosene and $w$ liters of whale oil, totaling $V + w$ liters. The whale oil lantern has $V - w$ liters of whale oil left.\n\n3. **Mixing**: The kerosene lantern is thoroughly mixed, so the concentration of whale oil in it is $\\frac{w}{V + w}$.\n\n4. **Second Transfer**: The keeper pours $w$ liters of the mixture back into the whale oil lantern. The amount of whale oil in this $w$ liters is $w \\times \\frac{w}{V + w} = \\frac{w^2}{V + w}$ liters, and the amount of kerosene is $w \\times \\frac{V}{V + w} = \\frac{V w}{V + w}$ liters.\n\n5. **Final Composition**:\n   - **Whale Oil Lantern**: Originally had $V - w$ liters of whale oil. After adding $\\frac{V w}{V + w}$ liters of kerosene and $\\frac{w^2}{V + w}$ liters of whale oil, the total whale oil is $V - w + \\frac{w^2}{V + w} = \\frac{V^2}{V + w}$ liters. The total volume is $V$ liters, so the concentration of whale oil is $x = \\frac{V^2}{V(V + w)} = \\frac{V}{V + w}$.\n   - **Kerosene Lantern**: Originally had $V$ liters of kerosene and $w$ liters of whale oil. After removing $\\frac{V w}{V + w}$ liters of kerosene and $\\frac{w^2}{V + w}$ liters of whale oil, the remaining kerosene is $V - \\frac{V w}{V + w} = \\frac{V^2}{V + w}$ liters. The total volume is $V$ liters, so the concentration of kerosene is $y = \\frac{V^2}{V(V + w)} = \\frac{V}{V + w}$.\n\n6. **Difference in Concentrations**:\n   $$x - y = \\frac{V}{V + w} - \\frac{V}{V + w} = 0.$$\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{0}$.",
