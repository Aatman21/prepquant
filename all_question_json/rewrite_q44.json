  "title": "Orchard Arbitrage",
  "stem_md": "In a sunny orchard, there are three fruit baskets labeled **Apple**, **Berry**, and **Cherry**. You have **1 crate** of harvest credits to place bets on which basket will be the heaviest at the end of the day. You may bet fractions of a crate. The payout rules are:\n\n- If **Apple** is heaviest, you get **2 crates** for every 1 crate bet.\n- If **Berry** is heaviest, you get **4 crates** for every 1 crate bet.\n- If **Cherry** is heaviest, you get **6 crates** for every 1 crate bet.\n\n*(Note: Your initial bet is not returned.)* There is an arbitrage opportunity here. Calculate the **maximum guaranteed profit** (in crates) you can secure from this arbitrage.",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – light nudge: The implied weights (probabilities) of each basket winning can be derived from the payout ratios.",
    "Hint 2 – deeper clue: The sum of the implied weights is less than 1, indicating an arbitrage opportunity. Find betting proportions that equalize the payout across all outcomes.",
    "Hint 3 – near-full path: Allocate your bets inversely proportional to the payouts to ensure the same profit regardless of the winning basket."

  "detailed_solution_md": "### Step 1: Calculate Implied Weights\n\nThe implied weight (probability) of each basket winning is the reciprocal of its payout ratio:\n\n- **Apple**: $\\text{Implied weight} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- **Berry**: $\\text{Implied weight} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- **Cherry**: $\\text{Implied weight} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Implied Weights\n\nSum the implied weights to check for arbitrage:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} < 1\n$$\n\nSince the sum is less than 1, an arbitrage opportunity exists.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Betting Proportions\n\nTo guarantee the same profit regardless of the outcome, bet in proportions inversely proportional to the payouts. Let the bets be $a$, $b$, and $c$ crates on **Apple**, **Berry**, and **Cherry**, respectively, such that:\n\n$$\na + b + c = 1\n$$\n\nAnd the payouts are equal:\n\n$$\n2a = 4b = 6c = K\n$$\n\nSolve for $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $K$:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{K}{2}, \\quad b = \\frac{K}{4}, \\quad c = \\frac{K}{6}\n$$\n\nSubstitute into the total bet equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{K}{2} + \\frac{K}{4} + \\frac{K}{6} = 1\n$$\n\nMultiply through by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n$$\n6K + 3K + 2K = 12 \\implies 11K = 12 \\implies K = \\frac{12}{11}\n$$\n\nNow, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{12/11}{2} = \\frac{6}{11}, \\quad b = \\frac{12/11}{4} = \\frac{3}{11}, \\quad c = \\frac{12/11}{6} = \\frac{2}{11}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Verify Equal Payout\n\nCheck the payout for each outcome:\n\n- **Apple wins**: $2a = 2 \\times \\frac{6}{11} = \\frac{12}{11}$ crates\n- **Berry wins**: $4b = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{12}{11}$ crates\n- **Cherry wins**: $6c = 6 \\times \\frac{2}{11} = \\frac{12}{11}$ crates\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Guaranteed Profit\n\nTotal bet: $1$ crate\nPayout: $\\frac{12}{11}$ crates\n\nProfit:\n\n$$\n\\frac{12}{11} - 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}} \\text{ crates}\n$$\n\n**Final Answer:** The maximum guaranteed profit is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{11}}$ crates.",
