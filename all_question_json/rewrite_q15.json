  "stem_md": "A mischievous squirrel is organizing a picnic with $10$ snack baskets. Each basket can either contain **hazelnuts** ($H$) or **acorns** ($A$). The squirrel has a peculiar rule: acorns can only appear in **consecutive pairs**, never alone. For example, with $4$ baskets, arrangements like $AAHH$, $AAAA$, and $HHHH$ are valid, but $HAHH$ and $AAAH$ are not.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly arranged sequence of $10$ baskets follows the squirrel's rule?",
  "hints": [
    "Hint 1 – Consider how valid sequences can end: either with a hazelnut ($H$) or a pair of acorns ($AA$).",
    "Hint 2 – The number of valid sequences of length $n$ can be broken down into sequences ending with $H$ (which depend on sequences of length $n-1$) and those ending with $AA$ (which depend on sequences of length $n-2$).",
    "Hint 3 – The recurrence relation resembles the Fibonacci sequence. Use initial conditions for small $n$ (e.g., $n=1$ and $n=2$) to identify the pattern."

  "detailed_solution_md": "Let $s_n$ denote the number of valid sequences of length $n$.\n\n### Step 1: Recurrence Relation\nAny valid sequence of length $n$ must end in one of two ways:\n1. **Ends with $H$**: The first $n-1$ baskets can be any valid sequence of length $n-1$. Thus, there are $s_{n-1}$ such sequences.\n2. **Ends with $AA$**: The first $n-2$ baskets can be any valid sequence of length $n-2$. Thus, there are $s_{n-2}$ such sequences.\n\nThis gives the recurrence relation:\n$$ s_n = s_{n-1} + s_{n-2} $$\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions\n- For $n=1$, the only valid sequence is $H$. Thus, $s_1 = 1$.\n- For $n=2$, the valid sequences are $HH$ and $AA$. Thus, $s_2 = 2$.\n\n### Step 3: Fibonacci Connection\nThe recurrence relation matches the Fibonacci sequence, with $s_n = F_{n+1}$, where $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, $F_3 = 2$, etc.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $s_{10}$\nUsing the Fibonacci sequence:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nF_1 &= 1, \\\\\nF_2 &= 1, \\\\\nF_3 &= F_2 + F_1 = 2, \\\\\nF_4 &= F_3 + F_2 = 3, \\\\\nF_5 &= F_4 + F_3 = 5, \\\\\nF_6 &= F_5 + F_4 = 8, \\\\\nF_7 &= F_6 + F_5 = 13, \\\\\nF_8 &= F_7 + F_6 = 21, \\\\\nF_9 &= F_8 + F_7 = 34, \\\\\nF_{10} &= F_9 + F_8 = 55, \\\\\nF_{11} &= F_{10} + F_9 = 89.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThus, $s_{10} = F_{11} = 89$.\n\n### Step 5: Total Possible Sequences\nEach of the $10$ baskets can independently be $H$ or $A$, so there are $2^{10} = 1024$ total possible sequences.\n\n### Step 6: Probability Calculation\nThe probability $P$ of a valid sequence is:\n$$ P = \\frac{s_{10}}{2^{10}} = \\frac{89}{1024} $$\n\n**Final Answer:** \n$$ \\boxed{\\dfrac{89}{1024}} $$",
