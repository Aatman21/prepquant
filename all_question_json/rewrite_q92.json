  "stem_md": "In a sunny orchard, pickers can reserve *future fruit baskets* at a fixed price. These baskets contain a mix of apples and oranges, but the *reservation price* is set based on the current market value of apples alone. \n\nA picker reserves a basket that is *deeply unlikely* to be worth picking (the current apple price is far below the reservation price). What is the *basket gamma*—the rate of change in the basket's *pick likelihood* as apple prices fluctuate—for this reservation?",
  "hints": [
    "Consider how the pick likelihood changes when the basket is very unlikely to be picked.",
    "The pick likelihood is almost unaffected by small changes in apple prices in this scenario.",
    "The second derivative of pick likelihood with respect to apple price is zero for deeply unpicked baskets."
  ],
  "detailed_solution_md": "Let’s define the variables:\n- $A$ = current apple price (underlying asset price)\n- $K$ = reservation price (strike price)\n- $P(A)$ = pick likelihood (option price)\n- $\\Gamma$ = basket gamma (gamma of the option)\n\nFor a deeply unpicked basket (deep out-of-the-money call), $A \\ll K$. The pick likelihood $P(A)$ is nearly **zero** and insensitive to small changes in $A$:\n\n1. **First derivative (Delta)**: $\\frac{dP}{dA} \\approx 0$ (pick likelihood doesn’t change).\n2. **Second derivative (Gamma)**: $\\Gamma = \\frac{d^2P}{dA^2} = \\frac{d}{dA}\\left(\\frac{dP}{dA}\\right) \\approx \\frac{d}{dA}(0) = 0$.\n\nThus, the *basket gamma* is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\Gamma = 0}$$",
